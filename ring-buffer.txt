- Explain how the ftrace ring buffer works in a few sentences. 

The ftrace ring buffer is a list of pages indexed using a linked list.
The ring buffer uses four main pointers, the head_page pointer which is the
pointer to next page that should be read, the tail_page pointer which is the
pointer to the next page that should be written to, and the commit page which is
the pointer to the page that was last written to by a non-nested write.
A writer in the ring-buffer can interrupt and stop another writer already executing
its write, but the interrupting writer must finish writing before the interrupted
writer can continue its execution. In this way, the writers can be "nested" in  a
hierarchical stack starting with the first writer that was interrupted or preempted.
The first preempted writer is always the last writer to commit its write. A
non-nested write it therefore one done by the last writer in the pre-empting
writer stack.
At initialization, the head_page, tail_page and commit_page all point to the same
page.

The ring buffer also has a reader_page that is usually only used by the
reader/consumer (tasks that read from the buffer). At initialization, this page
is allocated aside from the ring buffer with its next pointer pointing to the
head page, and its previous pointer pointing to a page before the head page.

During a write to the ring buffer, the next position available for writing is 
reserved and passed to the producer/writers (tasks that write to the ring buffer). 
The writer commits the write, when it's done.

During a read from the ring buffer, the reader will swap its page with the
head_page if its page is empty.
The previous reader page then becomes part of the ring buffer, and the head_page
is removed. The page after the newly inserted reader_page becomes the new head_page
in the ring buffer.

- Explain how and when a trace record in the ring buffer is converted to text when
/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace is read.

The ftrace ring buffer uses a binary format. Each trace event has a format file 
associated with it containing descriptions of field logged and the format string
used to print the event in text mode.
This description is used to parse the binary trace stream during a read of the ring
buffer.
The ring buffer also only stores pointers to strings referenced by events and not
the strings themselves. The strings can be obtained by parsing the printk_format
file in the trace sysfs directory in order to map the pointer to the actual string.

- Say you increase the ftrace buffer size by writing 1024 to maxbuffer_sizekb
(I forget the actual name of the sysfs file -- find it). How much physical RAM
ends up being consumed, and what factors does the RAM consumption depend on?

The buffer_size_kb file is used to set or display the size of the trace buffer for
each CPU. The size written into this file is usually rounded up to the nearest page
size for allocation.
The number of pages allocated is limited to the percentage of memory available, and
requesting too large of a request is usually denied.
The memory allocation is also influenced by the page size used by the kernel, as memory
will be allocated in full pages (part of a page cannot be allocation and is instead rounded
up to a full page).

On a 64-bit system, with a 4kb page size, a buffer size of 1024 will end up using
4MB of physical RAM.

- Where is the code in the kernel that allocates memory for the ftrace ring
buffer? Could you point it out?

The buffer's memory is allocated in the __ring_buffer_alloc function in the
kernel/trace/ring_buffer.c file:
